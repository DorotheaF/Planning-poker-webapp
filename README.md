# Planning-poker-webapp
Created a planning poker webapp summer 2020 with a virtual agile team for Northrop Grumman. The code is proprietary, but here is a screenshot and short video of the product after 8 weeks:

This is the scrum master's view with control buttons.

This is a user's view after the cards were revealed and the user stories were assigned points.

This is the webapp in quarter screen size, demonstarting the dynamic scaling and component organization.


Here is a [video version](https://github.com/DorotheaF/Planning-poker-webapp/blob/master/Watermaked_PPDemo.mp4) of the entire app's functionality.

We used meteor, a combination of React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB
